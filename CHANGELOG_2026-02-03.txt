- Report output includes columns: `document`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `count`.

- Added 3-step upload follow-up when template endpoints return upload_url.
- Added template upload mode (update/create) using UI-style multipart fields.
- Manifest stores document category ID when available.
- Template upload now uses data[filename]/data[file]/data[document_category][id].
