# Clio Templates & Custom Fields Update Automation Project

## Changes
- Added CSV reporting of replacements per document to `mass_update_templates.py`.
- Introduced a `Replacement` dataclass to retain original Old/New text with compiled regex.
- Updated replacement flow to track per-replacement counts alongside total counts.
- Added `--report` CLI option and default report output (`replacement_report.csv`).
- Report output includes columns: `document`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `count`.
- Added `--join-runs` option to replace placeholders spanning Word runs.
- Join-runs mode preserves surrounding formatting and uses the first run's style for replacements.
- Added `clio_templates_sync.py` to bulk list/download templates via Clio API.
- Added manifest-based workflow to reuse downloaded IDs for uploads.
- Added `requests` dependency for Clio API calls.
- Added `clio_oauth_app.py` for OAuth login and token capture.
- Added token-file support and refresh handling in `clio_templates_sync.py`.
- Added `Flask` dependency for the OAuth helper app.
- Added optional HTTPS support for the local OAuth helper.
- Added `cryptography` dependency for adhoc HTTPS certificates.
